# Dynamic On-Palm Manipulation via Controlled Sliding

This is the repository that contains source code for the [website](https://dynamic-controlled-sliding.github.io/) for Dynamic On-Palm Manipulation via Controlled Sliding.

This source code borrows the .css style from the [Nerfies](https://nerfies.github.io/) template. Specifically, it excludes the slider/interpolation code from the original Nerfies code.
